GymPapi is a fitness-focused e-commerce website that allows users to browse, select, and purchase gym accessories and workout products through a simple, modern, and user-friendly interface. The platform includes features like product listings, shopping cart, checkout flow, and responsive design, making it easy for customers to shop online.

### 💡 Why We Made GymPapi

We created GymPapi as part of our E-Commerce course project to understand how real online stores are built and managed. Instead of coding everything from scratch, we chose WordPress + WooCommerce to learn how modern e-commerce businesses actually operate today.

Our goal was to:
- Explore how e-commerce websites are built using CMS platforms
- Understand product management, cart systems, checkout flows, and payment integration
- Learn how plugins, themes, and hosting work together
- Experience the full process of designing, deploying, and maintaining a live store
- Create a clean, fitness-focused online shop for gym accessories
- GymPapi allowed us to combine technical skills with practical e-commerce concepts, giving us hands-on experience with real-world tools used by thousands of businesses.
